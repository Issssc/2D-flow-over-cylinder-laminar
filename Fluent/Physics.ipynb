    "**In developing CFD simulation for a fluid mechanic problem understanding the general physics and fundamental theory of the problem is extremely important. This knowledge would provide users the ability to make logical decision about the geometry of CFD domain, choice of proper boundary conditions and numerical models for the CFD simulation. Furthermore, user will have a general big picture on the expected outcome of simulation. These knowledges and abilities form the foundation for a successful implementation and validation of the CFD simulation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**In other words, understanding physics and theory of problem before developing a CFD simulation can be thought of turning on a flash light before taking any step in a completely dark room. Hence, let's review the fundamental physics and theory behind the problem of 2D laminar flow over a cylinder as the first step for development and validation of CFD simulation for this problem of interest:**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most fundamental and interesting case study in field of fluid dynamics is the evolution of the flow field as the fluid interacts with a blunt object. Among different shapes for a blunt object, 2D cylinder is known to be one of the most applicable and popular geometries and many scientists investigate the flow field around this shape both numerically and experimentally. The behavior and physics of the flow field is strongly dependent on the ratio of inertial to viscous forces (a.k.a Reynolds number) within the flow. As this ratio increases the physics of the flow around and in the wake of the cylinder would change. This evolution is visualized in Fig. 1 below.\n",

    "Fig 1. Sketch of the flow field evolution around a cylinder according to the ration of inertial to viscous forces (i.e. Reynolds number) within the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand physics and perform a general analysis on the flow field over a 2D cylinder, control volume analysis approach is used. By definition, a Control Volume is a limited inertial frame of reference within the continuum of a flow, that encloses the blunt object and flow field around it. There are three major physical variables that will be conserved within this Control Volume: **mass**, **momentum** and **energy**. Writing the conservation for each of these variables would provide important information about the behavior of the flow around 2D cylinder: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conservation of mass ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The general form of equation for conservation of mass applied to a defined control volume is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int_{CV} \\rho~dV + \\int_{CS} \\mathbf{n}~.~\\rho \\mathbf{V}~dA = 0 .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation $\\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $\\mathbf{V}$ is the flow velocity on the control surfaces of the control volume boundaries, which has an area of $dA$ and a normal vector of $\\mathbf{n}$. In this case study since the flow is steady state the first term of the equation will be equal to zero. The second term, however gives the incoming and outgoing mass flux within the control volume. Considering that the most important component of the flow velocity is the streamwise component this equation can be simplified furthermore and knowing the variation of incoming velocity into the control volume will give the variation of the out going velocity field from the boundary of control volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conservation of momentum ###\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain a general understanding from the interaction between the flow and cylinder the equation for conservation of momentum will be used. There are two force components acting on the body of cylinder. One force component is in the streamwise direction and is called the **Drag Force**. The other component is perpendicular to the flow direction is called the **Lift Force**. Due to the flow field symmetry, the lift forces acting on top and bottom of cylinder cancel each other and the net lift force on the cylinder will always be equal to zero. However, there will be a significant drag force on the cylinder as a result of it's interaction with the flow. To obtain the drag force acting on the cylinder, one can consider the conservation of momentum in streamwise direction. The general form of conservation of momentum equation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{R_{ext}} + \\mathbf{F_v} -\n",
    "\\int \\mathbf{n}~p~dA +\n",
    "\\int \\rho \\mathbf{g}~dV = \n",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\int \\rho \\mathbf{V} dV +\n",
    "\\int (\\mathbf{n}~.~\\rho \\mathbf{V}) \\mathbf{V} dA .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above equation assuming that the effect of viscous forces within the flow ($F_v$) are negligible within the Control Volume around the cylinder, neglecting body forces and assuming a steady state flow, terms one, four and five from right in the above equation will become zero respectively. Furthermore, due to having a uniform flow entering the CV one can conclude the pressure would be constant in the streamwise direction at the boundaries of the control volume. Application of all these assumptions to the conservation of momentum equation will result in:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{R_{ext}}= \n",
    "\\int (\\mathbf{n}~.~\\rho \\mathbf{V}) \\mathbf{V} dA .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple equation implies that the total drag force on the cylinder is equal to the change of momentum between the incoming and outgoing flow form the boundaries of the defined control volume. It should be noted that this equation is based on the assumption that the boundaries of the defined control volume are far from the cylinder body.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Dimensional Analysis ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing dimensional analysis on the flow over a cylinder immersed in a flow of a constant velocity $V$, it can be shown that the drag force acting on the cylinder is described to be a function of following flow variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbf{F_D} = f (d,\\mu,\\rho,V) ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d$ is the dimension of the cylinder, $\\mu$ and $\\rho$ are the viscosity and density of the fluid. As there are 5 variables and 3 reference dimensions (i.e., $M, L, T$), two $\\Pi$ groups are needed to fully define the flow field around a cylinder defined which has following definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pi_1 = \\frac{\\rho V d}{\\mu} = Re\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Pi_2 = \\frac{\\mathbf{F_D}}{d^2 \\rho V^2 }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, as shown previously using control volume analysis, it can be concluded the drag force on the cylinder is a function of velocity field as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\mathbf{F_D}}{d^2 \\rho V^2 } =  \\phi(Re) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The left hand side of the above equation sometimes is showed as the drag coefficient as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C_D = \\frac{2\\mathbf{F_D}}{A \\rho V^2 }  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation $F_D$, the total drag force due to pressure and viscous forces within the flow acting on the cylinder's surface in the streamwise direction. It is normalized with the available momentum in the undisturbed incoming flow that could be exerted on the cylinder. The value of this momentum is calculated using $\\rho$ as the reference density of the flow, which is the density of the flow. $V$ as the undisturbed streamwise flow velocity in the inlet and $A$, which is the projected area of the cylinder surface. For a two-dimensional cylinder the projected area is equal to the diameter of the cylinder. This is the area where pressure and viscous forces are acting on the cylinder in the streamwise direction. It should be noted that the pressure and viscous forces in the perpendicular direction to streamwise direction cancel each other. Hence, the forces and areas that they act on does not have any contribution to the drag force and coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can tell from the analysis above, both calculating the velocity field and the drag force need a lot of efforts. This is particularly true if one want to reach a high accuracy, let along dealing with some more complex situation. This is when computational fluid dynamics, or **CFD**, come into place. With the help of CFD, one can divide the area of interest into multiple small *control volumes*,called meshes, where a steady state is always satisfied. Once input the physical settings for the flow, the computer can finish the calculation without consuming much human power. Thus, with proper meshing methods and input parameters, CFD is an effective approach to obtain the velocity field and drag coefficient."
