    "# CFD Simulation Case Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "**The created CFD domain is now read into the CFD package of interest to setup the CFD simulation. It should be noted that the current tutorial has a significant difference compared to other available CFD tutorials online! This tutorial is structured and developed based on a generic and methodological approach to set up a CFD simulation. The first principals and reasonings for each setting is discussed at each step. Potential alterations and modifications to perform similar analysis for different flow conditions are also addressed and discussed. Hence, in the end user will have the capability of applying potential modifications, improvements or extending the application of the current CFD simulation to a more complex problem of interest, rather than having a one time successful run of a specific simulation with specific and strictly pre-defined boundary conditions.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **_In simple words: Current tutorial teaches users to fish, rather than giving them a fish._**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up a CFD simulation has following four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the physics of the flow field user will select required model/s to simulate the flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "User will define the physical and thermodynamical properties of the working fluid/s and solid/s in the problem.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary & Zone Conditions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving the governing equations of the flow (i.e. system of partial differential equations) requires well-defined boundary conditions within the CFD domain. These conditions are selected and defined in this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Setup Solution Methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In CFD simulations the governing equations of the flow are solve numerically. Based on the physics of the problem appropriate numerical schemes and solution methods are selected at this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following section the details for the above-mentioned four steps of the CFD simulation setup process for the case study of **2D Laminar Flow Over a Cylinder** are explained in great details. As a general guideline, to setup a CFD simulation in OpenFoam it is recommended to start with files from one of the provided default tutorials in OpenFoam located in `OpenFoam/run/tutorials`. Users should find appropriate tutorial such that the general physics of the chosen tutorial is close to the problem of interest of users. This way, the majority of the required physical settings are pre-set and the others can be changed/modified accordingly. For example for the problem of **2D Laminar Flow Over a Cylinder** the tutorial of **2D over an airfoil** located at `OpenFoam/run/tutorials/incompressible/simpleFoam/airFoil2D` is used. Using the previously developed file, the above-mentioned four steps for CFD simulation development is done via editing the corresponding files, where the settings are defined and are located in the main working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Setup Model/s:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main assumption in the classical problem of a two dimensional flow over a cylinder is that the free stream flow is uniform and steady. Therefore, the steady model is chosen to develop this CFD simulation. This along with other numerical schemes settings are set in a dictionary file called \"fvSchemes\" located at `\\system` folder. To set the solver to be steady users define `Steadystate` for the `ddtSchemes` and the rest of the settings will remain unchanged:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "ddtSchemes\n",
    "{\n",
    "    default         Steadystate;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "In cases where the flow properties rapidly changes with respect to time, such as cases where the Reynolds number, based on cylinder diameter (as the length scale), is greater than the critical value of 100 in which unsteady vortex shedding will begin to happen around the cylinder the appropriate Transient model should be chosen in this step. Various available time schemes along with other implementable option within \"fvSchemes\" dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/fvschemes/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current problem the focus is to investigate laminar wake and boundary layer behavior when a uniform flow passes over a cylinder. The appropriate model for this problem is set in a dictionary file called `RASPropertise` (RAS stands for Reynolds Averages Stress) located at `\\constant` folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "RASModel        laminar;\n",
    "\n",
    "turbulence      off;\n",
    "\n",
    "printCoeffs     off;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that the critical Reynolds number for turbulent flows over a cylinder is about $10^5$. In cases that the Reynolds number, based on cylinder diameter (as the length scale), is greater than this critical value the appropriate turbulent model should be selected at this step. Various available turbulence models along with other options within `RASPropertise` dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/turbulence/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Setup Working Fluid/s & Solid/s:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of working fluid is problem dependent. In the absence of obligations to define a specific working fluid such as air or water, it is suggested that the users define the working fluid such that the important non-dimensional groups of interest, such as Reynolds number in this problem, is matched the desired flow conditions. This strategy removes the uncertainty in the choice of the working fluid and will solidify the bases for expected physical observations. The material properties in OpenFoam can be defined in a dictionary file `transportPropertise` located in `constant` folder. In this file the material is set to be `Newtonian` fluid with a defined kinematic viscosity **\\nu**. It should be noted that the numbers in the [] set the dimension of the flow field variable of interest and the other number sets it's value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "transportModel  Newtonian;\n",
    "\n",
    "nu              nu [ 0 2 -1 0 0 0 0 ] 0.04;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Considering that the cylinder diameter in 1 [m] and user will define a unit constant uniform velocity (1 [m/s]), the value of **\\nu** will be defined as the inverse of Reynolds number. Therefore, changing this value would set the nominal Reynolds number of the flow based on the cylinder diameter. For other cases users should define the working fluid via this process. Various available transport models along with other options within `transportPropertise` dictionary file in OpenFoam can be found [here] (http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/transport-rheology/#x40-2210007.3.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Setup Boundary and Zone Conditions:**   \n",
    "In OpenFoam the type of boundaries within the CFD domain are defined in the `boundary` file located at `\\constant\\polyMesh`. Whether the users use blockMesh or the convert command to create the CFD domain and discretize the `boundary` file will be created in this process. Furthermore values for the field variables, such as velocity **U** and pressure **p**, at these boundaries are set in `U` and `p` files located at `0` folder located in the working directory respectively. The `0` folder includes the values of the field variables at boundaries for the time `t=0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed earlier in the CFD domain's creation and discretization section, the CFD domain has four faces as boundaries. The boundary and zone conditions settings to develop CFD simulation for **2D Laminar Flow Over a Cylinder** case in OpenFoam are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inlet:** The flow enters from the inlet face of the CFD domain with constant velocity and uniform atmospheric pressure (i.e. zero gauge pressure). To set the type of this boundary edit `boundary` file in `\\constant\\polyMesh`. Set the type of face to `patch`, which is a condition that contains no geometric or\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outlet:** The flow exits the CFD domain from the outlet and top face of the domain and reach atmospheric pressure (i.e. zero gauge pressure). To set the type of this boundary edit `boundary` file in `\\constant\\polyMesh` and set the type of face to `patch`, which is a condition that contains no geometric or topological information about the mesh:\n",

    "If in a problem of interest, there exist a specific pressure difference between the inlet and outlet or other surfaces, that magnitude can be defined in corresponding faces of the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**top & bottom:** The CFD domain is bounded via two surfaces on top and bottom named after their location within the domain as **top** and **bottom** respectively. These two surfaces have significant distance from the cylinder, which is located in the center of the domain. Therefore, any potential blockage effect or forced accelerated flow around the cylinder is removed. In order to make sure that these boundaries would replicate a semi-infinite domain in two directions a Symmetry boundary condition is set to these surfaces. This condition would reflect identical flow field to the other side of the surface.

Based on the orientation of coordinates in the current CFD-domain the drag force direction is along x-axis (1 0 0), the lift force direction is along y-axis (0 1 0) and pitchAxis is along z-direction (0 0 1). The center of origin called `CodR` is located at (0 0 0). The other inputs for this function are reference values for velocity, density, diameter and area used to normalize the drag force to calculate the drag coefficient. Usually the values for these variables are defined as the free stream flow properties. In this case study reference values of velocity, density and diameter are all equal to 1. However, the value of reference area \"Aref\" should be defined differently! Fundamentally, the reference area to calculate the drag force coefficient is defined as the total \"effective\" area that the force of interest is acting against. In case of the flow over a cylinder the fluid forces on the body of cylinder can be visualized as shown in the Fig. 1:\n",

    "Each force component can be decomposed into two components in the horizontal and vertical directions shown with red and green colors respectively. Due to the symmetry of the geometry the vertical components of the forces cancel each other. Therefore, the total drag force is the summation of all horizontal forces that are acting against the projected area along the cylinder's wall as visualized in the zoom-in view of Fig. 1. This area is defined as the reference area `Aref` and is equal to diameter times the depth of the cylinder. For the current CFD domain the diameter is 1 [m] and the created depth of the mesh via \"blockMesh\" is 2.8 [m]. Therefore, the value of the reference area is 2.8 $[m^2]$. Note that for a purely 2D problem (with no depth in mesh) the value of depth is considered to be unity. Therefore, in that case the value of the reference area is 1 $[m^2]$\n",
